### Description

I have created a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md from a user's input using the inquirer package.

### Process

- First I worked on my Index.js file to create an array of questions to prompt the user, call that prompt through a function, and write the user's responses to a new markdown file.
- Then I worked on my generateMarkdown file to manipulate exactly where the user's responses would end up in the markdown file itself.
- Once I finalized my JS files, I ran a few tests through the node terminal.

* Finally, I filmed myself walking through the typical user's flow.

### Installation

- I installed this application through node.js.

### Usage

- My application will be used to create a professional README markdown file that a user can include with any of their application projects.
